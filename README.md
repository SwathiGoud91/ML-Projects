# ML-Projects
## Learning Context
These projects were developed as part of a workshop where I learned the fundamentals of machine learning.  
The workshop helped me practice:
- Regression (Salary Prediction)
- Classification (Placement Prediction)
- Data preprocessing and evaluation metrics
- # Salary & Placement Prediction Models

## About the Project
This repository contains three machine learning projects developed during a workshop:
1. **Salary Prediction (Regression):**  Predicts salary based on years of experience.
2. **Placement Prediction (Classification):** Predicts whether a student is placed or not based on communication skills and CGPA.

## Learning Context
I built these models as part of a workshop where I learned the basics of regression and classification using Python and scikit-learn.  
The workshop helped me understand:
- How to preprocess data
- The difference between regression and classification problems
- Evaluating models using metrics like RMSE, accuracy, and F1-score

## Tech Stack
- Python  
- scikit-learn  
- pandas, numpy  
- matplotlib (for visualization)  

## Future Improvements
- Add more features (e.g., certifications, projects, interview scores)  
- Experiment with advanced models (Random Forest, SVM, Neural Networks)  
- Improve accuracy with hyperparameter tuning
